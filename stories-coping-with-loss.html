        <h2>How did I Battle with my Inner Demons - Anonymous, 25</h2>
        <p>
          They say that our inner demons enter our lives in the form of
          compulsive thoughts which later on drives the way we feel and think.
          The emotions and negative thinking make us feel like crap. And at that
          moment, it becomes impossible to switch off the feelings and turn the
          volume down of those inner demons. The same situation happened with me
          when I lost the hope of moving ahead in my career. I became such a
          hopeless person when someone from higher authority told me that I
          can’t do this because I am not capable of it. That sentence really
          pinched me and I started feeling like crap. I stopped making extra
          efforts and I stopped communicating with my loved ones. My inner
          demons enclosed my hopes in such a way that I thought I was a useless
          person with no desires at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few months later, filled with hopelessness, I thought about what
          made my inner demons so hard to conquer. I literally felt those inner
          demons getting strong day by day under my skin to make me weaker. That
          day I caught myself from hurting others and myself specifically. I
          searched a lot about my negative thoughts and feelings on the
          internet. And I found BeingWell a few weeks ago on the internet. I
          started reading blogs and self-help books which helped my inner demons
          to let go. I observed that the removal of such negative feelings
          requires self-introspection and humility. BeingWell taught me that
          once you know your demons, own them, and acknowledge them! Once you
          acknowledge your fear, you have already won half of the battle. I
          chose the higher ground from where I stood and fought with my inner
          demons. I shouted, “I can! And I am capable of achieving my desires
          and goals”. By doing so, I defeated my inner demons by making angels
          out of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned that our inner demons are also angels waiting desperately
          for a miracle to happen. Actually, they also require help in the same
          manner that we do. When the inner demons are treated with kindness and
          grace, they arise like a new personality. At the end of the story, I
          fought on the side of such angels, and in this way, I battled with my
          inner demons and won. In the end, I would like to send regards to the
          BeingWell team members who all are working together for better healthy
          living. Big thanks to everyone!
