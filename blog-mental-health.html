          Passive Scrolling On Social Media Linked To Anxiety, Stress, and
          Depression
        </h1>

          <p>
            Recent research published by the “Behavior & Information Technology”
            says that passive scrolling on social media is linked to anxiety,
            stress, and depression. Are you also someone who endlessly scrolls
            on social media without even connecting through the content you
            watch?
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, I get that. There are some days when we just don’t want to
            connect with anyone and mindlessly watch reels or posts. But is that
            the right thing to do? Research suggests passive scrolling on social
            media can increase the risk of anxiety, depression, stress, and
            other mental health issues!
          </p>

          <h2>Taking a Brief Look at the Study</h2>
          <p>
            The Journal of Behavior and Information Technology recently
            published a study surveying 288 people between the ages of 18 and 34
            to explore the link between social media use, psychological
            distress, and loneliness. The study categorized social media users
            into three groups: passive scrollers, active non-social media users,
            and active social media users.
          </p>

          <p>
            The researchers found that passive scrolling on social media is
            associated with a higher risk of depression, stress, and anxiety. In
            contrast, active engagement, such as creating and sharing content,
            was linked to improved social well-being and reduced distress.
          </p>
