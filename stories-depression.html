        <h2>Financial Crisis Was Hard On Me – Anonymous, 52</h2>
        <p>CS Team February 18th, 2020</p>
        <p>I was stressed and under depression when I had no money to take care of my family, my business failed and even I had a heart attack. It happened all of a sudden (actually it was going for 4 years) but after the surgery, I understood that it was major depression that was drowning my physical health too. Later, I started practicing Yoga religiously and now I am in a better state. I want to tell you all to take care of your mental as well as physical health.</p>
