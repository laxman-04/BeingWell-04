          Smoking & Depression: Dealing With Depression Related To Quitting
          Smoking
        </h1>

            A recently published study shows that regular smokers are prone to
            developing mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and
            stress. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and people who
            quit smoking often experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms like
            irritability, insomnia, restlessness, and depression. Depression is
            one of the most common complaints during early cessation.
          </p>

          <h2>Smoking and Depression: What’s the Connection?</h2>
          <p>
            Nicotine increases dopamine in the brain, creating dependence. When
            smokers quit, they often experience withdrawal, leading to temporary
            depression. According to psychologists, feeling sad or depressed
            after quitting is common and typically resolves within days or
            weeks. However, severe depression may last longer and require
            professional intervention.
          </p>

          <p>
            People with a history of mental health issues are at a higher risk
            of experiencing depression after quitting smoking. Studies show that
            many experience symptoms of major depressive disorder after
            cessation.
          </p>
