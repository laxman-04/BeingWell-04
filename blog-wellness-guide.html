            A lot of people ask, “Is depression a disability?” To understand
            this, let's explore what psychotherapists have to say. Severe or
            chronic depression can impact daily life, making it difficult to
            work, walk, or even get out of bed. Depression manifests differently
            in everyone and can sometimes lead to disability.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), depression is
            considered a psychiatric disability as it can affect quality of life
            and, in some cases, the ability to work.
          </p>

          <h2>Is Depression a Disability?</h2>
          <p>
            Clinical depression is one of the most common mental health
            disorders worldwide. Here are some common symptoms of depression:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Changes in appetite</li>
            <li>Consistent sadness</li>
            <li>Emptiness</li>
            <li>Hopelessness</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <li>Lack of concentration</li>
            <li>Unexplained weight loss or gain</li>
            <li>Self-harm or suicidal thoughts</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For a diagnosis, these symptoms must persist for more than two
            weeks. Depression is considered a leading cause of disability in
            people aged 15 to 44. It often develops after the age of 32, but can
            occur at any stage of life.
          </p>

          <h2>What We Can Do?</h2>
          <p>
            Since depression is considered a disability, individuals may qualify
            for assistance, including:
          </p>

              <strong>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI):</strong> For
              individuals unable to work for 12 months due to depression.

          </ol>
